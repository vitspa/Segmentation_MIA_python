"# Segmentation_MIA_python" 
This report presents an automated system designed to segment Drosophila
wings. Drosophila wings offer an exceptional subject for automated image
analysis due to their straightforward structure and significance in genetic de-
velopment, morphometrics, and evolutionary studies [1]. Despite the broad
utilization of Drosophila wings in scientific inquiry, the current landscape of
morphometric studies often relies on manual annotation of landmarks or key
points, a labour-intensive process that has fueled interest in automation [2][3].
The project workflow began with a concise literature research to assess the
state-of-the-art. Subsequently, a set of appropriate algorithms was chosen and
developed in Python, and finally, the best segmentation method was utilized
and evaluated on different test data.
